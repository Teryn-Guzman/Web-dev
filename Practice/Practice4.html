    <h1>History</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The evolution of the Belizean university can be traced over a 22 -year
      period beginning in 1977 with the establishment of the Committee for Sixth
      Form Studies in response to emerging concerns regarding the relevance of
      existing tertiary education, and ending in the year 2000 with a second
      attempt to coordinate and rationalize Belizean higher or tertiary
      education. During this time, the evolution of the university resulted in
      the establishment of three institutions: the Belize College of Arts,
      Sciences and Technology, the University College of Belize, and the
      University of Belize.
    </p>
    <h2>Previous attempts at national universities</h2>
    <p>
      Belizean nationalists long wished to decolonize the educational system and
      rely less on foreign academic institutions. In 1979 the ruling

        target="_blank"
        >People's United Party (PUP)
      </a>
      established the Belize College of Arts, Science, and Technology (BELCAST)
      as a state institution free of church involvement. The government secured
      funds from the
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community"
        target="_blank"
        >European Economic Community</a
      >
      for construction of a campus in Belmopan, but the campus was never built.
      On February 24, 1986, it was announced at a meeting of the National
      Council on Education that BELCAST would be closed. The rival

        >United Democratic Party</a
      >
      assumed power in December 1984 and later established an alternative
      college—the University College of Belize—in July 1986, created and
      maintained by
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_State_University"
        target="_blank"
        >Ferris State College </a
      >of Big Rapids, Michigan. Nationalists were dismayed that the new
      University College of Belize would be administered by non-Belizeans.
      Intense political controversy arose in 1991 when it was discovered that
      the university had not been properly accredited, calling into question the
      value of its degrees. A new PUP government severed its agreement with
      Ferris State College, and the state of Belize assumed full control over
      the university.
    </p>
    <h2>Amalgamation</h2>
    <p>
      The <em>University of Belize</em> was established in August 2000 as an
      amalgamation of five tertiary-level institutions: Bliss School of Nursing,
      Belize Technical College, Belize Teachers' College, University College of
      Belize, and Belize School of Agriculture. Except for the last one, all
      institutions forming UB were located in Belize City; UCB had established a
      college affiliate in Belmopan.
    </p>
    <h2>Divisions of study</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The university has four main faculties, each with departments. Each
      department offers degrees from associate degrees (1st undergraduate
      degree) to bachelor's degrees (undergraduate degree). The master's degree
      (graduate) program in Biodiversity Conservation & Sustainable Development
      is offered in partnership with the
